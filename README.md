## About Me Doing Data Science:

For about 15 years, I've done data science in the SF bay area for a wide variety of clients in B2C, B2B and SAAS contexts.  "Philosophically", I like to think of DS projects as a life-cycle beginning with exploration and specs, proper "data science" modeling in the middle, and enterprise reporting at the close to preserve any insights for continuing awareness.  My current focus is digital marketing data science.
